5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.

ans: CLient-server architecture means that the action mainly operate in user's device not on the server. Here processing and logical application 
are run on the browser thus mainimal server is required.
    In this architecture, only front-end part is exeuted like HTML, CSS, JS.
    It is faster, less load for server thus it is better for small web. 
    For example : In server-side the click of button result to request to sarver but in client-side the click of button is handled by browser.



6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.

Email: Stands for electronic mail, is used to send and recieve mail over the internet.
    (Google, Outlook) are widely used email.

FTP: Stands for file transfer protocol, used to upload and download files between computer and server over the internet.
    Uploading files and document to the government forms online can be its example.

VoIP: Stands for Voice over internet protocol, used to make audio or video call using the internet. 
    It enables real time communication that doenot use traditional tools.
    (Whatsapp, Zoom) are some of the example of VoIP.



7. ”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.

ans: Internet is a collection of many smaller and bigger network that are connected for communication with each other worldwide.
The network consists of home networks, school networks, mobile networks, ISP networks, and international backbone networks. Thus internet is a 
network of network.

ans: Packet switching is the process of transfering of data over the internet. It works in following method :-
    a. Data are split into smaller units called packet.
    b. Packet travells independently as packect donot need to travel in fixed path.
    c. Packet are examined by router so they can reach their destination in best path.
    d. At the destination the packet are collected and reassambledthem to correct order
    e. In case of packect being lost of damage, retransmission of packet can be done.

    Packet contains source and destination ip for tracking, and a sequence number to address in correct order.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions 
_________________________________

8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, 
they are being advised to use dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.

ans: The requirement of startup company is to host website that display same information and has low maintainace cost, so the best web design is 
to go with a static web as it lays its content static and takes less hardware component to work.
The suggestion they recieved was to use the dynamic website where I would disagree as :-
    a. The requirement of the client is of static web platform.
    b. A dynamic web is better for the big corporation where as the startup doesnot need a bigger platform.
    c. Dynamic platform requires more resource to develop and maintain and to regular maintain a dedicated tech guy is required, which cost greatly
    thats deviate to low maintainace cost.
    d. Dynamic platform are more complex and requires more tools and hardware.

    Thus it is not suitable to use a dynamic website and I would suggest them to go with staic website.



9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection is 
active. However, accessing the sitevia 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.

ans: As the system is running with the IP address but as the browse is done in domain name the server respond with the error, we can say that the 
DNS(domain name sysytem) failure occured. 
DNS is responible for translating the domain name to IP, but in this case the browser could not find the server as domain name is not changed to IP.
In direct 142.250.190.46, browser bypassed the DNS as no need of translation.
Possible nature as DNS failed:-
    a. Misconfiguration
    b. Blocked by network setting
    c. Not responding



10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does not want this information available
to the general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.

ans: A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive information, for this they can use three network of Internet, Intranet or Extranet but 
among them Extranet will be of best use.

Internet: A network that is interconnected to millions of small and large network that makes it globally available network.
Intranet: A private network developed for specific corporation, that utilize communication within the boundry of corporation.
Extranet: A extended network that is private by nature but provides special access of network to the accessed user.

In this case information must not go to global so Internet is not suitable and Intranet is only accessable for within the organization thus it is 
also not suitable. Whereas the Extranet lets special access, it can be used to share sensitive information without making it global.
