5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure. Give an example of when to use each.

Hierarchical : A hierarchical structure organizes information in a parent–child relationship, resembling a tree with a root and multiple branches.
It provides flexibility, supports exploration, and scales well as content grows due to division of main branch to further broken branch.

Linear : A linear structure presents information in a fixed, step-by-step sequence, where users move forward and sometimes backward in a 
predefined order. This structure is best suited for task-oriented processes where the order of steps is important. It limits navigation
flexibility but ensures clarity and reduces user confusion.


6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.

ans: The Three-Click Rule is a usability principle in User Experience (UX) design which suggests that a user should be able to find any 
information on a website within three clicks. If users require more than three interactions to reach their desired content, they may become 
frustrated and abandon the site.


7. ”Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.

ans: Plan before you do means of organizing the thoughts and ideas before starting designing or developing the website.

Card Sorting: It is a technique to understand the mental  of the user, and by that info making plans to support the mental power of the user.
Like a website for kid being colorfull and animation while for blind people the website contains audio formatted content.

Flochart: It is a visual representation of the plan. It maps out the process for the development, describe the flow of the program.

8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural 
model would you choose? Draw a rough diagram and justify your choice.

ans: The website contains hundred of pages with the context (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News) so the hierarchical structure can be best fit 
for it. In the hierarchical structure we can divide the (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News) in main and sub main categories, making it easier 
to navigate, makes it scalable as new sub group can be added.

Reasons for choosing hierarchical structure :
    a. Handles large content effectively
    b. scalable
    c. Reduces Cognitive friction


9. Auser visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a 
desktop screen. Analyze this design failure using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.

ans: The problem can be seen that the navigation menu that was hidden in a small icon that is hard to notice and it is not based on KISS principle
making it harder for user to use it. In this condition the user leaves the website within 10 sec.

KISS mentiion that keep it simple,stupid. It means to make the website simple, and easy to use while fixing the Cognitive friction os the user.
To place the content in 3 clicks. But the website here lacks the KISS principle, increasing the Cognitive friction.

Correct Approach:
    a. Display the main navigation menu prominently on desktop screens.
    b. Use a hamburger icon only for mobile or small screens where space is limited.
    c. Ensure users can immediately see and access core sections without extra steps.



10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines 
(SEO), and propose a better structure using Page Slugs

ans: The URL www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9 is considered poor practice for both users and search engines for several reasons:
    a. Unreadable and unfriendly making hard to understand; prod?id=55&cat=9 gives no clue that it’s about a product, let alone which product.
    b. Poor SEO Performance: Search engines prefer URLs with keywords that describe the content.

A Page Slug is a human-readable, descriptive URL segment that clearly indicates the content. 
eg: www.shop.com/electronics/smartphone-samsung-galaxy-s23
It is user friendly, accepted by seo and is easier to learn
