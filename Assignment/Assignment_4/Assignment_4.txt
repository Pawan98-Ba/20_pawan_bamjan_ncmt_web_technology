1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.

Legibility : refers to how easily individual letters and characters can be visually recognized. It mainly depends on factors such as font type,
font size, letter spacing, contrast between text and background, and overall clarity of characters. If a font is too decorative or the contrast 
is poor, the text becomes difficult to identify, reducing legibility.

Readability : refers to how easily a reader can read and understand a block of text. It focuses on the overall presentation and structure of 
content rather than individual letters. Readability is influenced by sentence length, word complexity, paragraph spacing, line 
length, headings, and content organization. Even if the text is legible, poor layout or complex language can make it hard to read.


2. What is the ”Rule of Thirds” in layout design?

ans : According to this rule, a layout is divided into three equal parts horizontally and vertically, forming a 3×3 grid with nine equal sections. 
The most important elements of the design—such as headlines, images, buttons, or focal points—are placed along the grid lines or at their 
intersection points, rather than at the exact center.


3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?

ans: Using too many fonts makes a design look cluttered and unprofessional, which distracts users and reduces readability. A limited set of fonts 
helps establish a clear visual hierarchy, allowing users to easily distinguish between headings, subheadings, and body text.


4. Define ”Responsive Web Design.”

ans : Responsive Web Design means designing a website so that it automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes, such as 
mobile phones, tablets, and computers. The layout, text, and images change smoothly so the website looks good and works properly on every device.

5. Explain the ”F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a web page.

ans: The F-Pattern of scanning describes how users commonly read content on a web page, especially text-heavy pages. Eye-tracking studies show 
that users first scan horizontally across the top of the page, then move down slightly and scan across again, and finally scan vertically down 
the left side, forming an “F” shape.

This behavior influences web design by guiding where important content should be placed. Key elements such as headlines, navigation menus, important
links, and calls to action are positioned along the top area and left side of the page to catch user attention quickly. Less important information 
is placed lower or to the right, improving usability and ensuring users see the most critical content first.


6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of where Blue, Red, and Green should be used.

ans : Colors in web design have a strong psychological impact because they influence users’ emotions, perceptions, and behavior. The right color 
choices can build trust, create urgency, improve usability, and guide user actions, while poor color selection can confuse or overwhelm users.

Blue : associated with trust, calmness, and professionalism letting a sense of reliability and security.
Red : represents energy, urgency, and excitement calling out warnings, alerts and error msg.
Green : symbolizes nature, growth, health, and balance.


7. Explain the ”60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.

ans : The 60-30-10 Rule is a color-balance principle used in web design to create a clean, visually pleasing, and well-organized layout. 
According to this rule, 60% of the website should be a primary color, 30% a secondary color, and 10% an accent color.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions

8. A website loads very slowly, causing users to abandon it. Upon inspection, you find the developer used high-resolution raw images directly 
from a camera. Explain the importance of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG) to solve this.

ans : To solve the issue, images should be resized to the required display dimensions, compressed using appropriate tools, and saved in the correct
format JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics. This improves website speed, reduces loading time, and enhances overall user experience.

Choosing the correct image file format also plays a key role. JPEG is best suited for photographs and complex images with many colors. 
It uses lossy compression, which significantly reduces file size with minimal visible quality loss, making it ideal for backgrounds, banners, 
and product photos. PNG, on the other hand, uses lossless compression and supports transparency, making it suitable for logos, icons, and 
images with text or sharp edges—but it usually results in larger file sizes.


9. You are designing a website for a Law Firm. The client wants to use a bright yellow background with Comic Sans font to look ”friendly.” 
As a web designer, critique this choice based on Color Theory and Typography principles, and suggest a better alternative.

ans: From color theory, bright yellow is associated with energy, playfulness, and caution, which can feel overwhelming or unprofessional in a legal
context. It may reduce readability, especially with text-heavy content, and could make users perceive the firm as less credible or serious. From a 
typography standpoint, Comic Sans is an informal, casual font designed for playful or child-oriented contexts. It lacks the professionalism, 
authority, and readability expected for a law firm, which relies on trust and credibility.

A better alternative would be to use neutral, professional colors such as navy blue, dark gray, or deep green. These colors convey trust, stability,
and professionalism while remaining visually appealing. For typography, it is recommended to choose a serif font like Times New Roman, Georgia, 
or Merriweather for body text, paired with a clean sans-serif font like Helvetica or Open Sans for headings. This combination ensures readability 
and communicates authority and reliability, creating a website that aligns with the professional image expected of a law firm.


10. A website looks great on a laptop but is unreadable on a mobile phone because the user has to zoom in and scroll horizontally. Identify the 
design principle missing here and explain how Media Queries/Fluid Grids could fix it.

ans: The issue described indicates a lack of responsive design in the website. The design principle missing here is Responsiveness, which ensures 
that a website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices, providing a usable and readable layout without requiring horizontal 
scrolling or zooming.

Media Queries in CSS allow designers to apply different styles depending on the device’s screen width, height, or orientation. 
For example, you can adjust font sizes, rearrange columns, or hide certain elements on smaller screens to improve readability and usability.

Fluid Grids complement this by using relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed pixels to define layout elements. 
This allows content blocks, images, and columns to resize proportionally based on the screen size.

By combining media queries and fluid grids, the website can automatically adjust its layout for laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, 
ensuring that users can view and interact with content comfortably on any device
