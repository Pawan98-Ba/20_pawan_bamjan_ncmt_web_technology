8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early.
Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

ans: There can be many risk in the website if negleting the testing phase, the potential risk cna be :-
    a. Security risk: Vulnerability may go unnotice if skipped the testing resulting a security hazard.
    b. Functionality risk: Some feature may not work or may work differently. Some module can clash to other if left unseen.
    c. compatibility risk: The website may not perform well across different browsers, devices, or screen sizes, leading to a poor user experience and reduced reach.
    d. Reputation Damage: A website that crashes, behaves unpredictably, or exposes sensitive data can damage the client’s credibility and customer trust.
Investing in testing may take time upfront, but it prevents costly fixes, protects users, and ensures a successful launch.
Skipping it may save money initially but could result in far greater financial and reputational losses later.

and result in mismatch between the client’s expectations and the actual website layout, causing wasted time and effort.
